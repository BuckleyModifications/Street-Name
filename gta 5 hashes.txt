I'm a new generation of millionaire. I don't believe in cynicism or working hard. Money is meaningless if you're spiritually bereft, you know what I mean? When you stepped in and helped me, you didn't see a highly successful entrepreneur.  You just saw a young, cool guy who got his bike stolen. And that's awesome, dude. So check this out.  I'm sending you $100,000 of stock in Animal Ark. That way, I'm invested in you, you're invested in me.  Sound cool?

Turns out organic pet food is totally recession proof! But it was never about the money for me, even when I floated the business on the stock exchange, and I'm totally unchanged by it. I'm a new generation of millionaire. I don't believe in cynicism or working hard. Money is meaningless if you're spiritually bereft, you know what I mean? When you stepped in and helped me, you didn't see a highly successful entrepreneur.  You just saw a young, cool guy who got his bike stolen. And that's awesome, dude. So check this out.  I'm sending you $100,000 of stock in Animal Ark. That way, I'm invested in you, you're invested in me.  Sound cool?

	0x1261E5B9 = The media circus that followed Leonora's death portrayed her as a lascivious harlot who preyed on men and dressed in a way that was "asking to be killed", but this is neither consistent with the facts nor with the masturbatory image I like to keep of her.<br><br>Leonora Johnson was born on August 29th 1952 in the Midwest. Her father Harold worked as a plucker in the local chicken farm, her mother Eileen as a slopper at the local dairy farm, so it's safe to assume that her expectations for life were set fairly low – a sloppy plucker, or some other rural thing. A sickly child, she suffered chest problems for many years, mostly as a result of the heavy smoking so in vogue at the time. Leonora was a quiet, unremarkable student whom one of her teachers described as "the kind of early physical developer and late mental developer that got a lot of attention from older boys and certain faculty members".<br><br>At the encouragement of her uncle – or possibly to get away from him – Leonora left school at 15 and hitched her way to Los Santos with dreams of becoming a movie star or model. After working as a waitress for a few months, it didn't take long for Leonora's childlike naiveté and stunning good looks to catch the eye of wolfish entertainment industry types, and she soon became a common face on the Vinewood party circuit and the casting couch circuit.<br><br>By the early 1970s, she was getting regular work in print ads, television commercials and minor movie roles. After a scene-stealing turn as a wise-cracking disabled prostitute in the 1973 film 'Rum Runner', the Los Santos Shepherd described her as "a pretty face to watch without perhaps much spark in the eyes" and shortly before her death she was allegedly a frontrunner for a leading female role in 'The Many Wives of Alfredo Smith'. Who knows how bright her future could have been if that pretty face hadn't been severed from her perfect body...

A jaded detective in an episode of The Science of Crime once told his stereotypically cocksure younger partner, "Know the victim and you will find the killer" and I've sacrificed 30 years, two marriages and a promising career as a photocopier salesman to knowing Leonora in every way imaginable, some that I'm not that proud of.

The most powerful tool of all is the tool of manifest generosity towards ideas, and towards the upward. That is, sometimes a peach tree issues forth fire and a great dove becomes born.<BR>That dove is money and the money should be spent by all to achieve manifest generosity, as each paradigm has shown those who understood. And manifest generosity is the god head and being the god head is the movement towards truth form. Truth form is important but it is difficult for the wrong to understand, so ask yourself, am I the right?<BR>And I prove that through my adherence to manifest generosity and by the Eagle and the dove and the peach tree and upward gravity and by understanding, above all, this manifest truth form? Yea, to some this will seem hard to understand but it will be revealed, and to some it will seem hard to understand and it will not be revealed because they did not seek truly because they were the wrong form of bird or topiary. If you seek wisdom, you will pay for it and seeking and paying are the same thing as is understanding, if you want it to be.

The dove is the dove of love and of truth that is an old metaphor and one that unites all knowledge under Epsilonism, and like all who pursue truth and love he does so not just by manifesting upward generosity but also by killing Unsaveables in the great fight between Kraff and his enemies that has gone on for paradigms. In the 4th paradigm it was energy. In the fifth paradigm it was fire. In the 6th paradigm it was the love of ignorance and the Eagle.<BR>In the 7th it was the great dispute in which Unsaveables learnt to take the form of conflicted reason. In the 8th, it was amnesia. In this 9th it is within the being form – that is the red, and he with red and of red in the hair form is not of Kraff and he is the embodiment of that which is Unsaveable. All of these paradigms will be revealed to you through upwards generosity. Their meaning shall be made clear as your role in the great battles will be made clear. Nothing is truer to the dove of love than killing Unsaveables.

All too often these days, the American Dream is reserved not for those who love thy neighbor but for those who stab thy neighbor in the back, which leads me to believe that you're probably not a rich man.  Plus I really need to get my karma back on track so, as a small token of my gratitude, I have sent one of our top-selling men's suits to your house.  If it doesn't fit, remember it's the thought that counts.  Take care,Saeeda~nrt~
